<h1 align="center">WebVR Chat</h1>

## About
WebVR-Chat is a VRChat-inspired game developed for web environments? It's intended to be an enjoyable 3D/VR Space for interacting with others.

I intend for this project to run Web clients and platforms that support them, such as Mobile, PC, and perhaps VR.

So far the project is a major W.I.P, and contains basic character controls, that are applied to world `ID: 00002` and `ID: 00002`

## How to Use
Simply clone the repository, via `git clone https://github.com/PebbleCat-Studios/WebVR-Chat.git`; Once cloned, you can host the project from localhost and simply access `/WebVRChat/index.html` to start.

Alternatively, you can launch the game via https://pebblecat-studios.github.io/WebVR-Chat/WebVR%20Chat/. Depending on your network speeds and client, the scene loading might take a minute.

## Contribution
For minimal contribution, you can simply provide feedback on the project, If you discover an issue or have a proper suggestion. Please open an issue or contact me via (pebblecatstudios@gmail.com) or via Discord (@PebbleCat).

In addition, if you have experience with (A-Frame) or such applications, any help would be greatly appreciated.
